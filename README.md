# JAHCARE SERVICES Website

This is a simple, static website designed for GitHub Pages. It follows a layout similar in structure to Julyardi's site (hero, sections, contact), but uses original code and design.

## How to publish on GitHub Pages

1. Create a new repository on GitHub (for example, `jahcare-website`).  
2. Upload **index.html**, the **css/**, **js/** and **assets/** folders.  
3. Go to **Settings → Pages**.  
4. Under **Build and deployment**, set **Source = Deploy from a branch**, then choose your default branch (usually `main`) and **/ (root)**.  
5. Save. Your site will appear at:  
   `https://<your-username>.github.io/jahcare-website/`

### Editing in VS Code
- Open this folder in VS Code.
- Edit content inside `index.html` (text) and `css/styles.css` (styles).
- Use the built-in **Live Server** extension for preview.

### Custom domain (optional)
You can add your own domain under **Settings → Pages** and enable HTTPS.
